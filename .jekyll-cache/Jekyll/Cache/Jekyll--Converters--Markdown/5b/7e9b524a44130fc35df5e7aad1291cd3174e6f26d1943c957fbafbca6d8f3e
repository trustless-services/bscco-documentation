<p>This page contains the planned release schedule for BSCCO.</p>

<p>All dates are tentative and may be postponed due to development delays.</p>

<h4 id="open-alpha-may-31-2022">Open Alpha: May 31, 2022</h4>

<p>BSCCO will initially be released as a c-lightning plugin.</p>

<p>This version will be usable on regtest for testing.</p>

<h4 id="mainnet-beta-july-31-2022">Mainnet Beta: July 31, 2022</h4>

<p>This version will bring mainnet support to BSCCO.</p>

<p>An interactive protocol for establishing a BSCCO channel may be included,
but may not be, since that doesnâ€™t really <em>need</em> to be defined by the protocol.</p>

<p>We also plan on having at least one simple app built using BSCCO for the beta.</p>

<p>Stay tuned for details.</p>

<h4 id="lnd--umbrel-support-september-31-2022">Lnd &amp; Umbrel support: September 31, 2022</h4>

<p>Support for LND and Umbrel will also come, eventually.</p>

<p>Not prioritizing this until BSCCO works smoothly on c-lightning.</p>
