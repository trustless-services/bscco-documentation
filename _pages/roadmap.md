### BSCCO Roadmap

This page contains the planned release schedule for BSCCO.

All dates are tentative and may be postponed due to development delays.

#### Open Alpha: March 31, 2022

BSCCO will initially be released as a c-lightning plugin.

This version will be usable on regtest for testing.

#### Mainnet Beta: April 30, 2022

This version will bring mainnet support to BSCCO.

An interactive protocol for establishing a BSCCO channel may be included,
but may not be, since that doesn't really *need* to be defined by the protocol.

We also plan on having at least one simple app built using BSCCO for the beta.

Stay tuned for details.

#### Lnd & Umbrel support: June 30, 2022

Support for LND and Umbrel will also come, eventually.

Not prioritizing this until BSCCO works smoothly on c-lightning.
