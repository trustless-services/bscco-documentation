### BSCCO Roadmap

This page contains the planned release schedule for BSCCO.

All dates are tentative and may be postponed due to development delays.

#### Open Alpha: June 2022

BSCCO will initially be released as a Core Lightning plugin.

This version will be usable on regtest, testnet, and signet.

#### GUI: July 2022

A GUI client for BSCCO, possibly one that runs in the browser.

#### Mainnet Alpha: September 2022

This version will bring mainnet support to BSCCO.

An interactive protocol for establishing a BSCCO channel may be included,
but may not be, since that doesn't really *need* to be defined by the protocol.

We also plan on having at least one simple app built using BSCCO for the beta.

Stay tuned for details.

#### Lnd & Umbrel support: Late 2022 - Early 2023

Support for LND and Umbrel will also come, eventually.

Not prioritizing this until BSCCO works smoothly on Core Lightning.
