<p>A new constroversy in the Bitcoin ecosystem is an attempt to introduce BIP-119 (OP_CTV) using the Speedy Trial mechanism, which was used to activate Taproot just one year ago.</p>

<p>Personally, I am a fan of covenants and I support OP_CTV, although I agree that Speedy Trial leaves much to be desired in terms of a coordination mechanism.
The fact that we glossed over Speedy Trial’s shortcomings when activating Taproot, which most did not and still do not understand, is painfully obvious today.</p>

<p>Introducing new consensus rules globally is quite difficult in Bitcoin, where many will be opposed form risk aversion or simple apathy.</p>

<h2 id="lightning-and-local-consensus">Lightning and ‘local consensus’</h2>

<p>The Lightning Network, comprised of payment channels between two nodes, offers an interesting comparison in terms of applying new consensus rules.
While in practice we use Bitcoin’s consensus rules so we can enforce Layer 2 transactions on the base layer, one can imagine other ways of agreeing
with your peer regarding payment channel state.</p>

<p>For instance, we can have channels backed by WBTC on Ethereum, stablecoins issued on Bitcoin, other blockchains, credit, or even databases.
These may lack the robust trustlessness that BTC on Bitcoin offers, but can potentially make up for that in other ways.
This is particularly true if the nodes sharing the channel share some trust, or an external enforcement mechanism (e.g. legal contracts).</p>

<p>The best thing is that Lightning allows such experiments without placing the rest of the network at risk.
And if any liquidity benefits are to be had, those can apply globally.</p>]]></content><author><name>Kishin Kato @ Trustless Services K.K.</name></author><category term="Discussion" /><summary type="html"><![CDATA[BSCCO enables individual Lightning channels, with their respective nodes' consent, to use mechanisms other than the Bitcoin blockchain as their settlement layer.]]></summary></entry><entry><title type="html">The Birth of BSCCO</title><link href="http://localhost:4000/birth-of-bscco/" rel="alternate" type="text/html" title="The Birth of BSCCO" /><published>2022-03-11T00:00:00+09:00</published><updated>2022-03-11T00:00:00+09:00</updated><id>http://localhost:4000/birth-of-bscco</id><content type="html" xml:base="http://localhost:4000/birth-of-bscco/"><![CDATA[<h2 id="virtual-channels-as-a-scaling-mechanism-for-ln">Virtual Channels as a scaling mechanism for LN</h2>

<p>The Lightning Network is often touted as a cheap payment method that enables micropayments on Bitcoin
without sacrificing on-chain decentralization.</p>

<p>While the latter half is true, whether LN remains cheap indefinitely remains a question.
Routing each payment comes with a risk of channel closure due to technical difficulties or malice.</p>

<p>The following equation must hold for LN to be viable:</p>

<p>(sum of LN fees) &gt; (sum of on-chain fees for LN channels)</p>

<p>And for each HTLC routed, there exists an equation that node operators should consider:</p>

<p>(expected value gained from HTLC) = P(success)*fee - P(channel close)*cost &gt; 0</p>

<p><em>(Note that this equation ignores the time &amp; resource cost of handling canceled HTLCs,
which account for the vast majority of payment attempts on the network.)</em></p>

<p>The problem lies herein; in order to route payments from potential bad actors, what would
the breakeven fee be, and what use cases does that price out? This unfortunate reality stems
from Lightning Channels necessarily using the blockchain as a settlement mechanism to
resolve potential disputes.</p>

<p>But what if we didn’t need to go on-chain? Could we reduce costs &amp; improve LN’s efficiency?</p>

<h2 id="introducing-bscco-trust-and-the-lightning-network">Introducing BSCCO: Trust and the Lightning Network</h2>

<p>BSCCO enables individual Lightning channels, with their respective nodes’ consent, to use
mechanisms other than the Bitcoin blockchain as their settlement layer. In other words,
you no longer have to use HTLCs, and can instead settle in various ways.</p>

<p>While the Bitcoin blockchain replaces courts and central planners as the final arbiters of
financial records, there are certainly cases where that level of power is not needed.
Maybe you trust your counterparty to honor a contract. Maybe your counterpary is a different
node of yours. In such cases, why use the inflexible Bitcoin blockchain when you could use
credit, stablecoins, custodial solutions, and more?</p>

<p>The idea behind BSCCO is to provide a generalized tool which can be combined with custom
logic to enable different types of record keeping for individual channels.</p>
